/** \brief Base class for all spatial indexing structures
    \details
A SpatialIndex is anything that holds PointInterface pointers
and organizes them in a manner accessible from outside.
This class defines what is necessary to be a spatial index - namely
the ability to find the cell in which a point is placed and to store
newly observed points. It should also be possible to check the size of
the occupied space, as well as to get cells neighboring any given cell.
